### HTML

### CSS

Word CSS is used for simplicity and general understanding. We actually write SASS, more specifically SCSS.

- When possible follow the [BEM naming](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) of HTML classes.
- Each BEM component has its own `_component-name.scss` file, in folder `components/` relative to main CSS file.
- Main CSS file in the theme has a name of `style.scss` (for the WordPress themes compatibility).
